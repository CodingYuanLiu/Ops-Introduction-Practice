# Storage

## Definition

Understandably, many computer users consider memory and storage to be the same thing. 

Whereas memory refers to the location of short-term data, storage is the component of your computer that allows you to store and access data on a long-term basis. 

An important distinction between memory and storage is that the former clears when the computer is turned off. On the other hand, storage remains intact no matter how many times you shut off your computer. 

Usually, storage comes in the form of a solid-state drive or a hard drive. Storage allows you to access and store your applications, operating system and files for an indefinite period of time.

## Types of Storage

### Magnetic storage devices

Today, magnetic storage is one of the most common types of storage used with computers. Any storage medium that utilizes magnetic patterns to represent information is considered magnetic media.

1. **Floppy Disk Drive (FDD)**

  - Definition

    A floppy disk drive (FDD), or floppy drive, is a hardware device that reads data storage information. 

    FDDs are used for reading and writing on removable floppy discs. 

    FDDs had four basic components:

    1. Magnetic read/write heads (one or two)
    2. A spindle clamping device that held the disk in place as it was spinning 300 to 360 rotations per minute
    3. A frame with levers that opened and closed the device
    4. A circuit board that contained all of the electronics.

- Pros & Cons

  **Pros**

  1. Floppies are cheap and can be used many times.
  2. It is small and lightweight.
  3. It allows random access to data.
  4. It is useful in transferring files between computers.

  **Cons**

  1. Floppies don't have much storage capacity.
  2. It is easily destroyed by dust and dirt.
  3. Floppies can get affected by heat.
  4. It is difficult to handle.
  5. It is more prone to data loss.

2. **Hard Disk Drive (HDD)**

- Definition

  A hard disk drive (sometimes abbreviated as hard drive, HD, or HDD) is a non-volatile memory hardware device that permanently stores and retrieves data on a computer.

  A hard drive is a secondary storage device that consists of one or more platters to which data is written using a magnetic head, all inside of an air-sealed casing.
  
  All computers have a hard drive installed in them, which is used to store files for the operating system, software programs, and a user's personal files. A computer cannot function without a hard drive installed, as it requires one to function properly.

  Although most hard drives are internal, there are also stand-alone devices called external hard drives, which can backup data on computers and expand the available disk space. External drives are often stored in an enclosure that helps protect the drive and allows it to interface with the computer, usually over USB or eSATA.

  As can be seen in the picture above, the desktop hard drive consists of the following components: the head actuator, read/write actuator arm, read/write head, spindle, and platter. On the back of a hard drive is a circuit board called the disk controller or interface board and is what allows the hard drive to communicate with the computer.

- Pros & Cons

  **Pros**

  1. It is cheaper than SSD.
  2. It has larger base storage capacity.
  3. HDD is more accessible than SSD.
  4. It has higher read-write cycles.

  **Cons**

  1. It's read-write speed is slower than SSD.
  2. HDD consumes more power than a solid-state drive.
  3. HDD produces distracting mechanical sound.
  4. The form factor of HDD is bulkier than an SSD.
  5. Tts susceptibility to data loss and integrity failure due to physical vulnerability.
